# react-eat-n-split

Eat-n-Split is a sub-clone of one of my favourite apps on splitting bills i.e. SplitWise. It is simple and effective for keeping logs among friends. This is my first meaningful react app, I learned to deal with forms in react, using hooks, and state management best practices.

Here's the project deployment - https://learning-react-eat-n-split.vercel.app/
